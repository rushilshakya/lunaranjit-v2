not interested in feminism  
seeped in racist thought  
nor to fight for women’s rights  
to become a corporate bot

don’t just shatter the glass ceiling  
ignoring the sticky floor  
if you came to save us  
you can take the exit door

if you really believe in sisterhood  
join us in our fight  
no, we are not voiceless  
just pass the goddam mic
