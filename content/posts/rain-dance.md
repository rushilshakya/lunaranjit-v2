Every year,  
monsoon winds arrive, soaking  
the dusty, parched valley floor  
faraway, hills tumble down to meet the river  
outside, the galli becomes a rivulet  
inside, the family of three start  
their annual rain dance of  
carefully choreographed steps  
with pots and pans and old paint cans  
placing them here, there, everywhere  
moving them, again and again  
to catch the heavenfall  
in drops and drips before  
they hit the mud floor, before  
the room becomes river  
soaking clothes and curtains  
and books galore

Next year,  
next year will be different  
we say,  
waiting for a few sheets of corrugated steel  
yet another year
