I would have  
stayed on the phone forever if  
I had known  
the next call across the ocean  
would come carrying a message and punch  
a hole in my heart  
where things fall and disappear like  
the Bermuda triangle  
names in photographs / scribbled notecards /  
moments  
in history / parts of family tree / political debates /  
trivia contests / stories / memories

Been five years, still  
things disappear  
into a hole in my heart  
shaped like my father
