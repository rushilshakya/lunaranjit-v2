<p>I joined an informal group pooling resources and coordinating to do what we can to mitigate the disaster. I shelved my plans to excavate my past and write about it.

<p>With the turn of the season, things are starting to look better. I got the writing grant (thank you, Queens Council on the Arts). I had a three new poems published in English and three essays published in Nepali in the last three months. I am brushing off old writing and working on new pieces. I am finalizing the writing workshop. I am still unable to focus only on writing but slowly, I am moving back towards my writing dreams.</p>
